# Safe and Sustainable Water Quality in the Philippines

The country is rapidly urbanizing, and its growing cities struggle to provide new residents with adequate water and sanitation services. People in the Philippines are coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, and millions are attempting to cope with a new challenge. They are deprived of life's most essential resource: water. Access to safe water is more important than ever for the health of Filipino families. 

# Micro Financing

One of the major barriers to safe water and sanitation is affordable financing. We created a loan program to address this barrier head-on. This program will help bring small loans to those who need access to affordable financing and expert resources to make household water and toilet solutions a reality.
